I started this project back in 2015 to start learning about swift and macOS development.

It also gave me the experience of publishing an app on the App Store.

Until this day, this app is a utility that I use to put my ideas in a visual way. That said, I just work on it sometimes when there is something I’m missing and I feel like implementing the fix/feature.

The code in the project is not structured in the best way possible, CanvasViewController has way too many responsibilities and the implementation of mouse gestures is very complicated as well, so that part of the app shouldn’t be taken as an example.

Even though I’m aware of the code structure issues, the app works well enough and it’s not a priority for me to work to improve this right now.

Other aspects of the app that are a bit left behind for a while are: QuickLook plugin and the iOS reader app. Maybe someday I will do something about it.

Then again, thanks for reading this and feel free to use the code to learn from what you can.

Fixes and improvements are welcome.
